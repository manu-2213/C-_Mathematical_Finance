// Goal: Create "FMLLib", a library of useful financial maths functions.

// Some cool excisting frameworks that do these are: Boost, GSL, and Quantlib.

/*
main.cpp - main method for testiing
matlib.cpp - function definitions for MF.
stdafx.h - list libraries used during the project.
matlib.h - header file containing function delcariations.

Observations: 
    To use a function defined in a different file, you must load a header file containing a declaration of the function (#include "matlib.h").
    .hpp is sometimes used for C++ leaving .h for C.
